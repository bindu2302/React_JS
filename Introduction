🔹What is React JS?
React JS (or simply React) is an open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, especially single-page applications (SPAs).
It helps developers build fast, dynamic, and interactive web applications by creating reusable UI components.

🔹Key Features of React JS:
Feature	                Description
🔁 Component-Based	   Build UIs using small, reusable components.
⚡ Virtual DOM	       Improves performance by updating only what's necessary in the DOM.
🧠 Declarative	       Describe what the UI should look like, and React takes care of the rendering.
🧱 JSX	               JavaScript + HTML syntax for writing UI code.
📦 Unidirectional DataFlow	: Data flows in one direction — from parent to child (via props).
🔧 Hooks	             Functions like useState and useEffect for managing state and side effects in functional components.


🔹Why Use React?
⚡ Fast and responsive
🛠 Modular and maintainable
🌍 Huge community and ecosystem
💼 Used by big companies (Meta, Netflix, Airbnb, etc.)

Ex: Hello World Example in React

import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'

function App() {
  return <h1>Hello, React!</h1>
}

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'))


🔹Real-World Uses of React:
⚡Dashboards (Admin panels)
⚡Social media interfaces (like Facebook)
⚡E-commerce product listings
⚡Messaging apps (like WhatsApp Web)
⚡Interactive forms and modals

🔹 How React Works (Simplified Lifecycle)
You write components using JSX.
React converts JSX into JavaScript behind the scenes.
React maintains a Virtual DOM in memory.
On data/state changes, it:
            Compares the new Virtual DOM to the old one
            Updates only the changed parts in the actual DOM

🔹Tools That Work Well with React
React Router → For navigation/routing
Redux or Context API → For global state management
Axios or fetch → For making API requests
Tailwind / Bootstrap → For styling
React Dev Tools → For debugging
